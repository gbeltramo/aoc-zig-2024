#+title: --- Part Two ---

The Elf looks quizzically at you. Did you misunderstand the assignment?

Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this
isn't actually an XMAS puzzle; it's an X-MAS puzzle in which you're supposed
to find two MAS in the shape of an X. One way to achieve that is like this:

#+begin_src text
  M.S
  .A.
  M.S
#+end_src


Irrelevant characters have again been replaced with . in the above
diagram. Within the X, each MAS can be written forwards or backwards.

Here's the same example from before, but this time all of the X-MASes have
been kept instead:

#+begin_src text
  .M.S......
  ..A..MSMS.
  .M.S.MAA..
  ..A.ASMSM.
  .M.S.M....
  ..........
  S.S.S.S.S.
  .A.A.A.A..
  M.M.M.M.M.
  ..........        
#+end_src

In this example, an X-MAS appears 9 times.

Flip the word search from the instructions back over to the word search side
and try again. How many times does an X-MAS appear?
